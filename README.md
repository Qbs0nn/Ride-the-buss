## 🎲 Ride the Bus - Card Game

## ✨ Features
- 🃏 Full gameplay logic (guesses, rounds, forfeits, multipliers)

- 🎨 Modern UI with theme picker

- 🎬 Smooth animations and transitions

- 💸 You want to chicken out? Forfeit and take a little bit of money with you!
  
## 🚀 Tech Stack
- HTML5

- CSS3 (with custom animations)

- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

## 📦 How to Run
- Clone the repo
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/ride-the-bus.git

## 🛠️ Future Ideas
- Save stats/history

- More card game variants

- Minigames to earn money if you lost it all (so also saves so you can't just refresh)
